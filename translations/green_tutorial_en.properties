page1_title=## Hello to Stack Overflow
page1_text=# If you wanna jump to playing the game,\
# don't worry, go ahead. But if you aren't\
# in hurry, there are few lines for you:\
\
# This game is hard. Well, not difficult,\
# at least not at the easiest difficulty,\
# even my 11 years old sister-in-law can\
# play it. But I'll warn you, you'll have\
# to use your head. A lot.\
\
# Furthermore, even learning this game\
# can be a bit of challenge, maybe not\
# so much for a skilled programmer, but\
# if you've forgotten, what prime is, you\
# will learn a thing or two. Programming,\
# for example. Well, not all of it, but..\
# the important stuff, I would say.\
\
# And at the end, there's feeling like\
# no other, not when you win by a luck,\
# but by your knowledge and skill.\
# When victory is deserved,\
# it tastes much sweeter.\
\
# I hope you'll have fun.\
#                                     B.
page2_title=## Firstly select a difficulty
page2_text=\
# Find all cards with green face (that's\
# the easiest difficulty), then split\
# the cards by back color, values are blue\
# and functions are orange.
page3_title=## Before each game
page3_text=\
# Select output value, from value deck.\
# Each player gets four functions.\
\
# Game is prepared, now play rounds\
# as long as nobody wins.
page4_title=## Select new input value
page4_text=\
# There is a new input value each round,\
# output value stays the same\
# for a whole game.
page5_title=## Choose functions to play
page5_text=\
# Each player chooses one or more function\
# cards from their hand. When everybody\
# selected their card(s), show them\
# to others. P.S. for the first time,\
# do not worry to select random ones.
page6_title=## Compute result, example 1
page6_text=\
# Function card transforms input value\
# into a different one. The goal is to get\
# as close to output value as possible.
page7_title=## Compute result, example 2
page7_text=\
# More functions can be combined\
# for better result. See Function guide\
# to learn how to use them.
page8_title=## Put away used functions
page8_text=\
# Used functions are put away, if there's\
# not enough of unused functions, shuffle\
# the used ones and add them to the bottom\
# of the unused ones.
page9_title=## Get new function cards
page9_text=\
# Each player gets as many new cards\
# as he used, only winners,\
# those who were closest to output value,\
# get one card less.
page10_title=## Game end
page10_text=\
# Play the round as long as somebody has\
# no cards, that player wins the game.\
# When you manage green cards, you can\
# add yellow ones, finally the red  ones.
